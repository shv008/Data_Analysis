# Data_Analysis
A collection of my data analysis projects, currently focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). More projects coming soon, including end-to-end workflows, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

# 📊 Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my Data Analysis repository!  
This space currently includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects on various datasets. Each notebook aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

- EDA notebooks with visualizations and statistical summaries
- Clean, commented code for better understanding
- Step-by-step exploration and data cleaning

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 What’s Coming Next?

This repository is a work in progress. Planned additions include:
- End-to-end data analysis pipelines
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Predictive modeling (using scikit-learn)
- Domain-specific case studies (e.g., finance, health, sports)
- Dashboards and reporting tools
